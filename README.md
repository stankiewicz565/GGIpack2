GGIpack contains the  shiny app  named  tinyapp2.  This app uses parquet files made 
from the brig  data release on 05/15/2023. This new data release merges the 
population data for each of the cell types together thus there is no more choice 
for population since there is no way to separate the data anymore. Moreover access to 
multiple public data  from openGWAS.
